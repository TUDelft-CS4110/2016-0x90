- We decided to use EvoSuite for the lab
- We decided upon a project to investigate, namely Joda-Time.
- We [forked](https://github.com/ValMai/joda-time) Joda-Time.
- We started using EvoSuite to generate a test suite for Joda-Time and to compare code coverage resulting from manual vs automated tests.
