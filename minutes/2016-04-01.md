- Martin defined aspects that would help us compare automated vs manual testing.
- The aspects are the following:
  - Code Coverage: ​**How much of the code is executed while running the tests?*​*
  - Correctness (Oracle): *​*Is the test actually checking the correctness of the code?*​*
  - Readability: ​**How easy is it to extract the problem from the given failing test?*​*
