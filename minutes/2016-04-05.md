*Drafted by Valentine.*

- Valentine asked questions to Annibale Panichella and came to this conclusion:
  - The report should focus on correlating different code metrics with complexity/readability of generated tests;
  - The test generation should be used with the whole-test-suite approach, because it has been proven to be better than single-target;
  - The report should inquire upon what causes EvoSuite to fail at testing certain pieces of code;
  - We should run EvoSuite on single classes that could hold something significant for our research.
