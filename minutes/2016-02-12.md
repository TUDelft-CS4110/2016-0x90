*Drafted by Martin.*

 - Everybody introduced themselves.
 - We decided that as *preparation for the next meeting* we will read: "Phil McMinn. Search-Based Software Test Data Generation: A Survey. Software Testing, Verification and Reliability, vol. 14, no. 2, pp. 105â€“156, 2004."
 - Valentine was going to set up the readme.
 - We decided to schedule weekly meeting on Skype and use a Doodle to pick the date/time.
 - Note: Martin is in the [PST -0800 TimeZone](http://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/pst).
