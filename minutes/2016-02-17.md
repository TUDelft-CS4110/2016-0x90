*Drafted by Valentine.*

- We decided upon a plan: each of us will read one of the mandatory papers, and then will choose (and read) another paper based on the paper we read. We must consult with the team when we have chosen a second paper. 
- We decided who reads what:
	- Martin will do Search-Based Software Test Data Generation;
	- Alexandra will do Evolutionary Testing of Classes;
	- Valentine will do Whole Test Suite Generation.
- **deadline**: 21-02, make a pull request for the first summary (mandatory paper). 
- **deadline**: 26-02, make a pull request for the second summary. 
- 27-02, we set up a meeting for merging all summaries. 
- **deadline**, 28-02: we submit our summary of summaries.
