## Introduction
Search based algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms (GA) are used for Test Data Generation.
These algorithms require an objective function to guide the search.
Using this single objective function to guide the search is a limitation, since the there are multiple factors that should be considered to guide the generation task,such as: ability to reveal certain kind of faults, induced execution time and memory consumption.

The paper presents a framework that uses *NSGA-II* (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm).
THe *NSGA-II* algorithms is an algorithm that evaluates the solutions according to Pareto dominance concepts and allows for the comparison of multiple objectives.
